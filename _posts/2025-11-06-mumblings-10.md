## Travel

### 1. Berlin

Another trip to Berlin, quickly followed by a trip to Valencia (Half Marathon, let's go!). The first leg was for work, but damn, Berlin looked fine, glowing orange in the autumn sun. I arrived on a Monday and went straight to the hotel before a little walk to explore.

**Day 2/3** - Hackathon day, the reason I'm back in Berlin. Hackathons are a great way to socialize with other engineers, leave your comfort zone, and meet new people at your company (or outside of it, if it's an external one). My **problem** with hackathons is the presentation side. Usually, it's those with the most polished presentation who get the win!

Either way, I had some fun with folks, learned a few things, and did an extremely last-minute presentation. The sweat was real.

**Day 4** was a normal workday but with a bunch of workshops and team rituals. My social battery by this point was low, and another late night was not what I needed, so I called it early and stayed in the hotel after work. Travelling for work is about finding that right balance: setting the right expectations and tapping out when you need to.

**Day 5** - Back on the road. Berlin airport is really quick to get through; I've never had an issue compared to UK airports. I did get here a bit early this time but made good use of the airport lounge (which is a first—and wow, it's amazing. Free everything). Extremely excited to be back home, back to Sabrine, and back to my pillows.

### 2. Valencia

October 26th was the Valencia Half Marathon. Around 12 weeks of training all led up to this. Except, the week before, I came down with a rotten cold. The worst possible timing.

Anyway, race report: The race went well, but I didn't hit my target. The humidity was high, it rained, and the cold was kicking my ass. But, I got the medal and completed my first SuperHalf! Proud nonetheless.

## Life

Other than travelling, life has been mundane, dealing with the standard UK change of seasons where _everyone_ gets sick. Sneezing, coughing, and headaches for everyone.

I came across this quote recently that I really resonated with:

> "Starting is humiliating, first attempt is hard, clunky but that feeling is learning"

That internal, uncomfortable feeling you have doing something new or for the first time... that is just the feeling of learning.

## Books

I'm reading (_listening_) to [Project Hail Mary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Hail_Mary). I didn't know this was even a book until the trailer for the upcoming film was released. Hooked. Its author is Andy Weir, the same author as [The Martian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_\(Weir_novel\)) (also a [film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_\(film\))), and it follows the story of a school teacher-turned-astronaut as he finds a solution for our dying sun, but not all is as it seems!

I'm also still reading [AI Engineering](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-engineering/9781098166298/). It's heavy, detailed, and thought-provoking. A must-read for all/most software engineers who are currently using AI tools left, right, and centre. Learn those basics. It's needed!
