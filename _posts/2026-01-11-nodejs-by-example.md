## About

Node.js By Example is a hands-on introduction to Node.js using annotated example programs. Inspired by [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/), [C by Example](https://www.cbyexample.com/), and other "by example" projects, it provides a practical way to learn Node.js through real, runnable code.

## How It Works

Each example is a standalone, executable JavaScript file with inline comments that explain what's happening. The site is generated from these annotated source files, so the examples are always accurate and runnable.

## Contributing

The project is open source and welcomes contributions. Check out the [contribution guide](https://github.com/MattBidewell/nodejsByExample/blob/main/docs/contribution.md) to get started.
