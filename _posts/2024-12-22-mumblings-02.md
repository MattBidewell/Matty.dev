## Life 👨🏻‍🦰

Advent of code is back - If you did'nt know its a daily coding challenge that runs through December. I've been doing it for the past few years and its a great way for som friendly competition. Let's see if I actually make it past day 10. **Edit**: I did in fact make it to at least day X

Some relections and highlights from 2024:

- **Speaking**: I've been doing a lot more speaking at work and at meetups. It's been a great way to share knowledge and learn from others. I've also been working on my public speaking skills and it's been a great way to improve my communication skills.

- **Travel**: I've been lucky enough to travel to a few places this year. Spain, Morocco, Norway, Sweden and more. The most I've ever travelled and suprisingly, I'm not tired of it yet.

- **Happiness and health**: I've been working on my mental health and happiness this year. I've come to appreciate the importance of taking care of myself and making time for the things that make me happy, and how my physical health is linked to my mental health. As part of this, I've retaken up running which has been a great way to clear my head and get some exercise.

## What I've written.. ✍️

Recently at work I've been exploring ways to improve our Developer Experience within a Monrepo powered by Nx. Here I've dumped some generic ways we've improved our DX using code generation for NestJS libs.

## What I've read.. 📚

Finished a re-read of the Pragmatic Programmer. Some key takeaway tips:

> The team speaks with one voice—externally. Internally, we strongly encourage lively, robust debate. Good developers tend to be passionate about their work.

This is interesting and hard, but is crucial to come across as single unit working towards a common goal. If you have team members in a team saying things different to what the team is saying, it can be confusing and make the team look unorganized and unreliable.

> ... But they [Pragmatic Programmers] don't trust themselves, either. Knowing that no one writes perfect code, including themselves, Pragmatic Programmers code in defenses against their own mistakes.

Don't trust yourself, and dont trust anyone else. Always be prepared for things to go wrong. This is why we write tests, and why we write code defensively.

## What I've watched.. 📺

Gave Venom 3 a shot... To be honest, dreadful. So much potential... wasted.

## What I've listened to.. 🎧

Started listening to:
- **The Rest is History**: A podcast that covers a wide range of historical topics. The hosts are engaging and the topics are varied. But the best part are the hosts who are engaging and funny.

- **The Rest is Classified**: A fantastic journey through the world of spies and espionage. Hosted by an Ex-CIA officer and a veteran security correspondent, they delve into the world of espionage and the stories that have shaped the modern world.
