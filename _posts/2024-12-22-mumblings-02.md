## Life 👨🏻‍💻

Advent of Code is back! If you didn't know, it's a daily coding challenge that runs through December. I've been participating for the past few years, and it's a great way to spark some friendly competition. Let's see if I actually make it past Day 10.

**Edit**: I did, in fact, make it to Day 13!

Some reflections and highlights from 2024:

- **Speaking**: I've been doing a lot more speaking, both at work and meetups. It’s been a fantastic way to share knowledge, learn from others, and improve my public speaking skills. Communication is such a vital skill in our industry, and it’s rewarding to see progress here.

- **Travel**: This year has been filled with travel: Spain, Morocco, Norway, Sweden, and more. It’s the most I’ve ever traveled, and surprisingly, I’m not tired of it yet. Each place brought unique experiences and inspirations.

- **Happiness and Health**: Mental health took center stage for me this year. I’ve learned the importance of self-care, prioritizing activities that make me happy, and recognizing the connection between physical and mental well-being. Running has become a regular part of my routine again, helping clear my mind while keeping me active.

## What I’ve Read 📚

I finished a re-read of **The Pragmatic Programmer**. Some key takeaways:

> The team speaks with one voice—externally. Internally, we strongly encourage lively, robust debate. Good developers tend to be passionate about their work.

This is both challenging and crucial. Externally, a team must present a unified front to avoid confusion and build trust. Internally, fostering a culture of open debate ensures better solutions and stronger collaboration.

> ... But they [Pragmatic Programmers] don't trust themselves, either. Knowing that no one writes perfect code, including themselves, Pragmatic Programmers code in defenses against their own mistakes.

This is why we write tests and adopt defensive coding practices. Trusting neither yourself nor others completely means always being prepared for failure and mitigating risks proactively.

I’m also currently reading [**Distributed Systems With Node.js by Thomas Hunter II**](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/distributed-systems-with/9781492077282/). It’s been a great dive into the complexities of distributed systems and how to leverage Node.js effectively in such architectures.

## What I’ve Watched 📺

- **Venom 3**: Gave it a shot… To be honest, dreadful. So much potential, wasted.
- **Squid Game**: Rewatched it in preparation for Season 2. Korean TV continues to impress with its storytelling and depth.
- **Silicon Valley**: A rewatch of one of my favorite shows. The humor, satire, and tech industry insights are as sharp as ever. This time my partner joined me, and it was fun to see her reactions to the absurdity of the tech world.
- **Dune Part 2**: A fantastic continuation of the story. The visuals, acting, and world-building are top-notch.
- **Wicked**: A delightful musical with a fresh take on the Wizard of Oz story. The performances were excellent, and the music was catchy.
- **Lord of the rings: Extended Edition**: A yearly tradition. The extended editions are a must-watch for any fan of the series. Tis the season and all.

## What I’ve Listened To 🎧

Started listening to:

- **The Rest is History**: A podcast covering a wide range of historical topics. The hosts are engaging and insightful, making history come alive in unexpected ways.
- **The Rest is Classified**: A fascinating exploration of espionage and the shadowy world of spies, hosted by an ex-CIA officer and a veteran security correspondent. It’s a must-listen for anyone curious about the stories shaping modern intelligence.

## Fitness 🏃🏻‍♂️

Running is back after a brief hiatus due to a tight calf. I’m gearing up for a 10-mile run on January 23rd, aiming for a finish time around 1:30. It’s exciting to set new fitness goals for the new year!

## Tech 🤖

I’ve started using [**Ghostty**](https://ghostty.org/), a new terminal emulator created by HashiCorp’s founder, Mitchell Hashimoto. Written in Zig, it’s designed for speed and efficiency, outperforming many other terminal emulators. The experience has been excellent so far, pushing me to rethink workflows and embrace innovation. While it’s ultimately “just” a terminal emulator, it’s refreshing to explore tools that challenge conventional approaches.

## Final Thoughts on 2024 🎉

This year was packed with highs and lows, growth and challenges. I’m incredibly grateful for the experiences and connections I’ve made. As 2025 approaches, I’m excited for new opportunities, adventures, and milestones. Here’s to a fantastic year ahead! 🥂
