Christmas time means Advent of Code... and present giving!

## Techy stuffðŸ¤–

- I've been hacking away at Advent of code. I've done well at consistently doing the daily challenges. Hoping I get them all done within the day of release for a bit of extra spice. [I host all my code on my github.](https://github.com/MattBidewell/adventOfCode/tree/main/2022)
- I've added an auto rebuild functionality to https://matty.dev. Now at 8am on Friday the site will rebuild using Netlify scheduled functions. Which are effectively just a managed Lambda implementation, pretty cool.
- For Christmas downtime, I think it's time to spend with the family and away from the screens. I'll probably wind down before Janauary picks up.
- I have big news, that I'll share soon..
