Knowledge sharing in engineering teams requires both creators and seekers. That's a fact. While documentation, demos, and findings need to be shared proactively, there's equal responsibility on team members to actively seek out information.

I've noticed a concerning trend: many engineers default to waiting for information to be told to them, rather than proactively discovering it themselves.

Has the natural curiosity that drives great engineering begun to fade? Or is this just the nature of 'vibe coding'? Anyway, here's what's been happening in my life recently...

## Life

A big change is coming up! I've handed in my notice at Beamery and have an exciting new challenge on the horizon. I'm very much looking forward to it!

In other news, I checked out the AWS London Summit! It was a great event.

There was an F1 pit setup where you could learn more about AWS's involvement in data analytics, but the queue was massive so I never got a chance to participate.

What stood out? Amazon's new 'serverless' database offering, [Aurora DSQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aurora-dsql/latest/userguide/what-is-aurora-dsql.html). It maintains ACID guarantees while also being 'infinitely' scalable. This could be an absolute game changer for serverless distributed SQL offerings.

### üìö Books

- [Murderbot Diaries - Vol 2](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Artificial-Condition-Murderbot-Martha-Wells-ebook/dp/B075DGHHQL) - I wasn't expecting volume 2 to be just as good as the first. What made it even better is that Apple TV dropped a trailer for the [TV Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEioDeOiqEs)!
- [Pro Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) - For some reason I'm reading the Pro Git book, and it's good. I'm learning... loads.

### üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Health

I've found a new interest in bouldering! I'm absolutely shockingly bad at it. Difficulty increases from V0-V9, and I can barely do all of the V0 climbs. My first session had me using muscles I didn't even know I had‚Äîthe DOMS was real.
