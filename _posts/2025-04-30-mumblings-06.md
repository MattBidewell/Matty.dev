Knowledge sharing in engineering teams requires both creators and seekers. That's a fact. While documentation, demos, and findings need to be shared proactively, there's equal responsibility on team members to actively seek out information.

I've noticed a concerning trend: many engineers default to waiting for information to be told to them, rather than proactively discovering it themselves.

Has the natural curiosity that drives great engineering begun to fade? Or is this just the nature of 'vibe coding'? Anyway. Life recently...

## Life

Got a big change coming up, handed my notice in at Beamery and got a big new exciting challenge in the near future. Very much looking forward to it!

### üìö Books

- [Murderbot Diaries - Vol 2](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Artificial-Condition-Murderbot-Martha-Wells-ebook/dp/B075DGHHQL) - wasn't expecting vol 2 to be just as good as the first. What made it even better is Apple TV dropping a trailer for the [TV Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEioDeOiqEs) for it!
- [Pro Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) - For some reason I'm reading the Pro Git book and it's good. I'm learning... loads.
