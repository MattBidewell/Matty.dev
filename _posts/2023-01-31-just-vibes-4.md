## Whats been happening ü§ñüë®üèª‚Äçü¶∞

- Generally January has been a reset for me. Spending a lot of time reflecting, planning and aligning myself and catching up with friends who, in 2022, my time had neglected. Friends are good.

- Over christmas I got a lego modal of the 2022 McLaren F1 car. It was a tough build, I wont lie. But look at this glorious machine. Shame the modal it's based on wasn't as successful.

- Work time has spent rewriting Java Lambdas into Typescript. Speeding up cold start performance from nearly 6s to 1s. Massive improvements at the expense of Engineering effort, classic example of use the right tool for the job. It's worth noting that AWS Lambda's did release the new [Snapstart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/snapstart.html) feature which is great, which would solve the issues with Java being slow to start.

- offbording, why? because ... I've left GDS, you can find out why here [where I talk about 2022](https://matty.dev/blog/2023-01-03-reflection-and-future). TLDR; GDS is a good place to work, I just couldn't see my self progressing as quickly in my career as I would like to have been.

- I'm excited to be starting at [Beamery](https://beamery.com/) as a Senior Software Engineer.

- Consistent in my running this month, a first since 2021! Currently averaging around 15km a week with 3k runs.

## Books üìö

- I'm currently reading [Tracers in the dark](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/690603/tracers-in-the-dark-by-andy-greenberg/) by Adam Greenberg. It's an investigation into the dark underworld of Cryptocurrancy. Its dark, but captivating. If this sounds interesting you can hear from the author on the [Darknet Diaries episode 'Welcome to Video'](https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/131/)
