## Techy stuff 🤖

It's 2023!

## Nerdy stuff 🤓

- Over christmas I got a lego modal of the 2022 McLaren F1 car. It was a tough build, I wont lie. But look at this glorious machine. Shame the modal its based on wasn't as successful.

## Books 📚

- I'm currently reading [Tracers in the dark](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/690603/tracers-in-the-dark-by-andy-greenberg/) by Adam Greenberg. It's an investigation into the dark underworld of Cryptocurrancy. Its dark, but captivating. If this sounds interesting you can hear from the author on the [Darknet Diaries episode 'Welcome to Video'](https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/131/)
