## What I've written.. ✍️

- [Hidden AWS Sam CLI features when using esBuild, Lambda and Typescript](https://matty.dev/blog/2023-01-26-hidden-sam-cli-features);
- [Reflection and future](https://matty.dev/blog/2023-01-03-reflection-and-future)
- [How I built this site](https://matty.dev/blog/2023-01-02-how-i-built-this-site)

## What I've been reading 📚

- Interesting read on [Stackover flow on the importance of reading Computer Science papers](https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/12/30/you-should-be-reading-academic-computer-science-papers/). On that, [heres a github repo containing a list of Computer Science papers.](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/tree/f28b9c9f6c52a81aa9e60521c794f1c3aeafa9a7)

- I'm currently reading [Tracers in the dark](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/690603/tracers-in-the-dark-by-andy-greenberg/) by Adam Greenberg. It's an investigation into the dark underworld of Cryptocurrancy. Its dark, but captivating. If this sounds interesting you can hear from the author on the [Darknet Diaries episode 'Welcome to Video'](https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/131/).

## Nerdy stuff 🤓

- Over christmas I got a lego modal of the 2022 McLaren F1 car. It was a tough build, I wont lie. But look at this glorious machine. Shame the modal its based on wasn't as successful.
