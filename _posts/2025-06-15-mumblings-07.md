# Life Update

It's strange how life can feel overwhelming and quiet all at once.

## Life

It's been a minute. I had my final hours at Beamery, a bittersweet end to a long and eventful two and half years. I haven't started the new role yet, have a week off in between. Looking forward to diving into new technical challenges and continuing to grow as a Senior Software Engineer.

I haven't been coding as much as usual, instead 'life' has been busy. Sabrine, my partner, moved into a new place and I'm following suit, but need to terminate my current tenancy agreement to be able to do so. Which isn't the end of the world, it's just... time-consuming.

### 📚 Books

- [Deep Work](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692) - I felt like my mind needed a reset and this book provided it. Deep Work reminded me to carve out focused coding sessions without distractions - something crucial when learning new technologies or tackling complex problems.

### 🏃🏻‍♂️ Health

Sabrine and I ran the St Albans 5K - her first ever race. I ran alongside her for support, and she smashed her sub-30 target with seconds to spare! The course was typically hilly for St Albans.

I've also committed to the [Superhalfs challenge](https://www.superhalfs.com/en/), starting with Valencia Half Marathon in October. Should be an interesting test of endurance.

On the climbing front, I've been progressing to V1 routes at various gyms. It's a nice mental challenge that complements the running.

## Looking Ahead

Between the career transition, new living situation, and fitness goals, there's plenty to keep me motivated. Sometimes the best growth happens during these in-between moments.
