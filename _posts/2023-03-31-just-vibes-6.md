## Life 👨🏻‍🦰

Not a super lot to update this month. Life and health issues have kept me back. On the plus side I visited Kent for a weekend away.

At work, I've been trying to deploy an update without causing problems downstream. My first full month here has been interesting, lots to learn about legacy code. We all create it, we all deal with it at some point.

What's been interesting here is we've inherited a slightly complex serverless system with half finished documentation. The true problem lies on its lack of observability. This makes for an interesting tug of war between priority of what to do next. Fun and exciting.

Personally, I've been playing around with GPT api. It's fun, it's exciting. I expect to get a few POCs out and online soon.

## What I've been reading 📚

Still reading [Software Engineering at Google](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/software-engineering-at/9781492082781/). Lot's of great insights on high performing large teams. Lots to learn.

Also still reading [The Catcher in the Rye](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5107.The_Catcher_in_the_Rye). Mixing up the morning commute with a fresh fiction book.


## TV and film 📺

TV and film have been relatively absent this month. If anything I've just had South Park on in the background sometimes.

Last of us was amazing.
