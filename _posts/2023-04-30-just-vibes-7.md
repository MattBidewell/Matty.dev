## Life üë®üèª‚Äçü¶∞

Hopefully had my last hospital appointment for a while. Had a string of problems including a cancer scare. It's made me revaluate a lot of things, I need to be healthier, happier.

As for work I've been into a lot of the gritty world of Beamery Integrations. It's complex, mysterious piece of work that can do with some TLC. I can really see my personal growth in these situations compared to myself 2/3 years ago. I have the confidence to say something architecturally looks wrong.

Here it's serverless that just isn't quite done right. Some things missing here and there. Spagheti architecutre. Lost domain knowledge. It's an exciting fun challenge to get into the weeds of it and start looking at ways to rip it out and put it back together but with stability and structure.

On a personal coding side I've been playing around with the ChatGPT APIs. Got a POC on a site here[todo](www.google.com). I've also been taking a deeper dive into Terraform and reading [Terraform: Up and running](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/terraform-up-and/9781098116736/).
