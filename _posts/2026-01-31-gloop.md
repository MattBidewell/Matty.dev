## About

Gloop is an experimental programming language created as a fun side project. It is designed to explore new ideas in language design and implementation. The language is implemented in Go and features a simple syntax and basic functionality to demonstrate core concepts.

The idea came about after reading the book ["Writing an Interpreter in Go"](https://interpreterbook.com/), which inspired me to create my own language from scratch (well from Go..).

The future goals for Gloop is to expand the language features with any new concepts I find interesting. Obviously that comes with out any guarantee of stability or usability, but it's a fun way to learn about programming languages and compilers.

## Features

- A C-like syntax for familiarity
- Basic data types: integers, booleans, strings, Arrays and Hashes (maps)
- Control flow constructs: if-else statements, while loops, for loops
- Functions with parameters and return values
- Higher order functions and closures
- Built-in standard library functions for common tasks (well.. for now its extremely limited!)
- REPL for interactive coding and testing
