Its been an good month for getting stuff done. The cold, darker days have a way of motivating me at times.

## Techy stuff🤖

- I'm spent time giving [https://matty.dev](https://matty.dev) some TLC. This includes:
  - Migrating all images to a better format (webp) - Still a work in progress. Need to check image sizing.
  - Migrating to Typescript 😍
  - Migrating to NextJS 13 🧪
  - Migrating to lazy load images.

- Return of LNUG! [(London Node User Group)](https://lnug.org/). Over at the [Beamery](https://beamery.com/) London HQ, we heard a great talk on [BaseLime](https://baselime.io/) by [Boris Tane](https://twitter.com/BorisTane) and [Platformatic](https://platformatic.dev/) by [Simon Plenderleith](https://twitter.com/simonplend).

- Recently, I came across an _issue_ when using AWS SAM. You can read more on a [post here](/posts/2022-11-06-aws-sam-cli). However, the TLDR; is that when running `sam build` and then `sam deploy` you should ideally not use `sam deploy -t {TEMPLATE PATH}`. This is because the Sam CLI builds the deployment package in the folder `.aws-sam`.

- Awesome new feature of the AWS console. Prefixing `/Resource` to your search query will allow you to search your own resources. For example `/Resource myAwesomeTaskDefinition`

- The great Mastodon migration. Great slightly over exaggerates the move but it was still fairly large. I too moved and you can find me (as of November 2022) over at [@MattBidewell@fosstodon.org
](https://fosstodon.org/@MattBidewell). Say hi.

## Life

- Formula 1 is finishing up. This was probably the most boring season since the Schumi years... Looking forward to next year.

- Start of Ice Hockey season! can I play? nope. Can I watch? yes! I highly recommend if you're in the UK and have an interest in sports, go down and watch your local team! [Elite league](https://www.eliteleague.co.uk/) or even smaller for example the [Huskies](https://haringeyhuskies.com/)

- I've starting cycling as part of my commute. My local area introduced rentable bikes and as I live a good mile away from the nearest train station, these bikes are convenient.

- Back running and running a consistent 15k (in total KM) each week. The goal is to get back to my rough 31min 5km by Christmas. I think I can do it!

## Books 📚

### [Sandworm](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/597684/sandworm-by-andy-greenberg/)
>Finished Sandworm. Did you know that NotPetya was (as of 2022) the most costly cyber attack in history. The attackers used a flaw in windows called [EternalBlue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EternalBlue) and Mimikatz software which extracts stored passwords from memory. This allowed the malware to spread quickly and uncontrollably.

### [Snow crash](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40651883-snow-crash)
>Snow crash by Neal Stephenson is great. It tells the story of Hiro Protaganist (amazing name btw) and his life in a futuristic America. Whats crazy about this book, is that it was written in 80's but accurately predicted the tech of today. For example, a virtual world named Metaverse. Highly recommend.

## TV

### [Andor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andor_(TV_series))

>Wow Andor has been amazing. A bit of a slow burner to start with but wow. I loved it. Sad that its ended but I cant wait for season 2. You don't need to be a fan of Star wars to really get into it, no back story is needed.
