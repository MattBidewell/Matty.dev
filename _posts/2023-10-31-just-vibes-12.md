## Life üë®üèª‚Äçü¶∞

What?! I've been doing this for a year now? Wow. I'm genuinely surprised  myself by keeping this consistent. Yes I haven't been on time for a huge chunk of them, but I've kept it up and thats what matters. Consistency over perfection.

So, the weather is changing, the clocks have gone back and the night starts at 4pm. Gym and running is a struggle. I'm in the market to get a bike which will make the current 20 minute journey to the gym to something as low as 5/6 minutes. I need that time saving.

Side note, I've been in St Alban's a month now, I love it here. It's a great place to live, and I'm so happy I made the move. I'm surrounded by nature and surprisingly my commute to Old Street is now quicker!

Work has also been going well - Most of time is being spent bringing a new integration up to feature parity with the previous version but with increase reliability and data integrity. Exciting things to come in the future in this space.

## What I've been reading üìö

Still reading [Chip War: The fight for worlds most critical technology](https://www.christophermiller.net/semiconductors-1). It's a great read, but I've been so busy I've not had the time to sit down and read it. I'm hoping to finish it by the end of the year, realistically.


## What I've ~~written.. ‚úçÔ∏è~~ built

The first inital version of [NodeJS by example](https://nodejsbyexample.dev) has been released. It's going to become an extensive dictonary of NodeJS examples that go further than the original documentation. The style is heavily inspired by the likes of [GoLang by example](https://gobyexample.com). It's an open source project with the code available on [Github](https://github.com/MattBidewell/nodejsByExample).
