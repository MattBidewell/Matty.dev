Inspired by [Matt Gaunt-Seo's](https://www.gaunt.dev/blog/2022/vibe-check-01/) Vibe check series, I've decided to start my own. The purpose is to get into a habit of reflection and writing, which conveniently go hand in hand.

## Techy stuff🤖

- Life at Government Digital Services (GDS) is good. My primary focus is in the space of Digitial Identity.

- I organise the monthly #NodeJS Community Meetup, where we talk about all things NodeJS.

- It's good experience to see how a large team like GDS uses NodeJS and as we introduce it to more backend areas, how can we improve and help each other.

- One philosophy I love here is that we code in the open. Everything we have worked on is located at the [GDS Github account](https://github.com/alphagov).

- I'm getting my hands dirty in the event-driven, serverless world as well.

- The AWS SAM CLI is great and using it in conjunction with a monorepo to deploy serverless architecture is a breeze.

- A great person to follow in this space is [Paul Johnston](https://twitter.com/PaulDJohnston).

- Tip when using the SAM CLI to build the code you should not use the `-t` with deploy/package. `sam build` will generate a new template file in the `.aws-sam` directory which is then the default location for future commands.

- Came across a render issue with Webkit based browsers and raised a [bug with Apple](https://twitter.com/MattBidewell/status/1583058487911010304)

## Life 🧑‍💻

- Re-finding my love for running. It's therapeutic to just go for a run it's almost like clearing out a memory cache.

- I'm back to recording my runs back in [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/17683490).


## From the webs 🌍
- [A list of 100k most used passwords](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/static-assets/documents/PwnedPasswordsTop100k.txt) - Ever thought to yourself what weird passwords are commonly used, here's a list.
- [Random accessible colour pairs generator](https://randoma11y.com/) - Useful if you're designing a site and want to get a pair of colours that are accessible.
- [SHA-256 what?](https://sha256algorithm.com/) - Beautiful site that details step by step what happens when you SHA256 a string.

## TV shows 📺

**SheHulk**

>Loved it. The execution of the overall plot was great, I look forward to the future of the Marvel world if this continues.

**Rings of Power**

>I was addicted to this from the start. As a massive fan of Tolkien's works, I entered this with a sceptical eye. But after the first few episodes, I loved it. The world-building is exactly what I've been missing from my life at the moment.

**Killing Eve**

>I never got around to watching this initially, but over the past few months I've been catching up with one or two episodes a week. It's amazing. The chemistry between Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer is incredible.

## Books 📚

**[NodeJS design Patterns](https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/)**
>This has been the best NodeJS content book I've read so far and I've read a fair few.

**[Sandworm](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/597684/sandworm-by-andy-greenberg/)**
>I find investigative journalism in the tech world interesting, especially around cybercrime from state actors. If that sounds interesting then check out [Count down to zero day](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/18465875-countdown-to-zero-day) by Kim Zetter
