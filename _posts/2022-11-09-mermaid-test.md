##Â Background

I've been using the Sam CLI for the past 10 months. It's great at deploying multiple resources onto AWS and managing local deployments for cloud-based architecture.

```mermaid

    participant Alice

    loop Healthcheck
        John->>John: Fight against hypochondria
    end
    Note right of John: Rational thoughts <br/>prevail!
    John-->>Alice: Great!
    John->>Bob: How about you?
    Bob-->>John: Jolly good!
