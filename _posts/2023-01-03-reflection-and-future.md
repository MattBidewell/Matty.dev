## Goodbye, 2022

## Personal

2022 was an interesting year for me. I left my previous role at A Million Ads and started a new one at GDS. I've found a passion for working on Open Source. I gained a silly amount of weight. I traveled to 3 countries. I refound my love for running. It was a good year, I realised a lot about myself, what I want to do and how I want to get there.

In the world of tech I've been busy. I've started work on my own (hobby) programming language called [Gloop](https://github.com/MattBidewell/Gloop). Learn a lot about lexical analysis and how NodeJS works. I've rebuilt this site and I'm satisfied with its current design and build. Found a bug in [Apple's Safari browser](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=246803). Found a [bug/undocumented feature in AWS Sam](https://matty.dev/blog/2022-11-06-aws-sam-cli). Started caring a lot more about web performance, and much more.

## Work

### GDS

It's been interesting. I love the problem space I'm working on and the engineers I work with are incredibly talented. However, it does have it's issues. Most of these issues are likely to be issues with my fit in the GDS culture and team, it's also likely these issues steam from what I expected from the role. However, it's not all doom and gloom.

I have spent a lot of my time at GDS in problem spaces that I'm passionate about. Open source. Authentication. Identity management. Just to name a few. The level of detail that we must go at to make sure our services meet the expectations of multiple different stakeholders is.. inspiring. It's great to be constantly reminded of the people my code will be reaching, theoretically, every single UK citizen and more.

Code and technology wise, it was nothing new for me. A LOT of OAuth2.0, NodeJS, AWS, Serverless tech (Lambda, Fargate etc). What I did learn was a lot around best SRE practices and using IAC more. I'm happy with that


### My future at GDS

I already know my time at GDS will not be long. My desire to build my career and become a better engineer will not be fulfilled at GDS, I can already see that. Which is a shame. There is also the cost of living crises in the UK. The average rent of a one bed home in London and home counties is easily over Â£1.4k now and rising. Since joining GDS and being there, I've had no mention of even hit of pay increases even at the rate of inflation, so technically in the past year I've had a pay decrease, much like the rest of the country. Something not feasible for the future.

## Onwards to 2023

I'll start by saying, I will be starting a new role in 2023. More on that soon.

When thinking of 2023 goals, I think it's best to make them measurable as possible and themed. In terms of accountability, I'll be including the goals in my vibe check series.

Goals:

- **Health Improvements**
  - Weight loss:
    - Target of 210lbs
    - Bonus < 200lbs
  - Running:
    - Distance: 500km
    - 5km time: < 30 mins
    - 10km time: < 1:05 hr

- **Personal development**
  - Write 12 vibe checks. (1 Per month)
  - Make at least 1 contribution to NodeJS or it's core packages

And that's all for now.
